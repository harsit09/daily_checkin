About git push --force     

Answer
The git push --force command is a powerful tool in Git that allows you to overwrite the commit history of a remote repository with your local changes, even if those changes would normally be rejected due to differences in commit history. This command is often necessary in situations where you have rewritten your local commit history (for example, after rebasing or amending commits) and need to update the remote repository accordingly.
How git push --force Works
Normally, when you attempt to push changes to a remote repository, Git ensures that your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch. If there are commits on the remote that are not in your local branch, Git will reject the push to prevent losing those commits. The --force option bypasses this safety check, allowing you to push your local changes regardless of the state of the remote branch12.
Example Scenario
Consider a scenario with two developers, Alice and Bob, working on the same branch:
Alice makes changes: Alice creates a new feature and commits her changes. She then pushes these changes to the remote repository.
bash
git push origin main
Bob makes conflicting changes: Bob also works on the same feature but does not pull Alice's latest changes before he modifies and commits his own version.
Bob rebases his changes: To clean up his commit history, Bob decides to rebase his work on top of Alice's latest commit.
bash
git rebase main
Bob force pushes: After rebasing, Bob uses git push --force to update the remote branch with his new commit history.
bash
git push --force origin main
In this case, Bob's force push will overwrite Alice's changes on the remote repository because it disregards the existing commit history. This can lead to loss of work if not handled carefully13.
Caution
Using git push --force can be dangerous as it can result in lost commits and disrupted collaboration. It is advisable to use it only when you are certain that overwriting the remote history is necessary. An alternative approach is using git push --force-with-lease, which ensures that you only force push if no new commits have been added to the remote since your last fetch14. This provides an additional layer of safety against accidentally overwriting others' work.
